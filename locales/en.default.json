I wish I never paid for the laser treatment as this was so much more effective.

I also used \"Mederma\" to prevent any scaring. I am especially pleased that you have the combo packages and you are based in the US. Your quick response to my order and the time that it arrived to my home was very satisfying. I actually received my shipment 2 days after I placed the order.

I dreamed of having them removed by surgery but was a bit worried and also the cost!! I then stumbled upon your site and after reading many of the testimonials I decided to buy it. Like someone else has said in it’s the waiting for the scab to fall of is the worse part, so many people feel they have the right to stare and say something! Eventually they fall of and how great does that feel!!! I am now in two my third week after doing the 3 on my face on 2 others on my body and they have all gone with only slight scaring which I no doubt will still heal even better! I would recommend that you use savl on, as i found it kept the scabs from drying out too quickly and aids healing as well as vit E oil, and cont with vit E after while scaring is still evident. Thank you so much, anyone feeling hesitant… DONT do it, it will change your life! ",

My 3 yr old had a wart above his lip and 2 \non his fingers. I took him to the dermatologist a total of 9 times. They\n used Everything on this kid. They even made it worse. The warts just \ngot bigger. I was very skeptical about ordering, but it did offer your \nmoney back if it didn’t work. I used it and within 4 days the wart on \nhis face fell off. It’s a miracle. I never thought we would get rid of \nit. I didn’t think the fingers worked because they didn’t turn black but\n I left the medicine on and about a week and half later I was holding \nhis hand and realized the warts were gone. They were huge warts so you \ncould feel them if you held his hand. The doctors made them alot bigger \nthan they were originally. Anyway, I’m very grateful and if anyone has \nwarts that they have tried everything, this is the stuff to get. Thank \nyou again \n\n",

I have many genital warts..I tried other products like oil \nthat applied 3 ties a day..but it’s BS.. When I bought wart mole vanish I\n kept the good thoughts.. And Some users report discomfort during the process, but many see positive results in the days following treatment. Oh \nMy God..it started to peel off..
